# A .names file in a directory affects how entries in that dir
# will be displayed.
# The format is:
# filename | crumbname | menuname
# Where filename is the file or directory name (filenames require
# the correct extension, directory names shouldn't have a trailing
# slash), crumbname is the name to display in breadcrumbs that include
# this entry, and menuname is the name to display in menus that
# include this entry.
# Any line starting with a # is a comment. Blank lines are ignored.
